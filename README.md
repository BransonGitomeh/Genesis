little configuration to do all my applications bundling from one webpack configuration, and share a server, written in express 4 and using es6 even on the client(babel), the clients are all written in mithril.js though any other framework can be used for a new project and es6 and all that will still work. Main framework is materialize.css to reduce the work for css and concentrate on building the functionality.
